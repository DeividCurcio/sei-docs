# Validator Operations Guide

This comprehensive guide explains how to operate a Sei validator node. We'll cover the complete lifecycle of a validator, from initial setup through ongoing operations and maintenance. Understanding these concepts is crucial for maintaining a reliable and secure validator operation.

## Understanding Validator Responsibilities

A validator in the Sei network serves several critical functions. As a validator, you are responsible for:

- Participating in consensus by proposing and validating blocks
- Maintaining high uptime and performance to avoid slashing
- Providing accurate oracle price feeds for asset pricing
- Managing delegator relationships and maintaining transparent operations
- Participating in governance and network upgrades

## Initial Setup

### Key Management

The security of your validator begins with proper key management. Your validator requires several distinct keys:

```bash
# Validator consensus key - Used for signing blocks
seid tendermint show-validator

# Operator key - Used for managing validator operations
seid keys add operator

# Oracle key - Used for price feed submissions
seid keys add oracle
```

These keys serve different purposes and should be managed with appropriate security measures. The consensus key, stored in `priv_validator_key.json`, is particularly critical as it's used to sign blocks.

### Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration

For production validators, using an HSM is strongly recommended. Here's how to configure an HSM with your validator:

<details>
<summary>HSM Configuration Steps</summary>

```bash
# Install required libraries
sudo apt-get install opensc pkcs11-utils

# Configure YubiHSM2
yubihsm-connector -d

# Generate key in HSM
yubihsm-shell

# Configure seid to use HSM
tee "$HOME/.sei/config/priv_validator_config.json" << EOF
{
    "chain_id": "sei-chain",
    "key_type": "yubihsm",
    "state_file": "$HOME/.sei/data/priv_validator_state.json",
    "hsm_serial": "YOUR_HSM_SERIAL",
    "hsm_key_id": "YOUR_KEY_ID"
}
EOF
```

</details>

### Validator Registration

Before registering your validator, ensure your node is fully synced with the network. Then create your validator:

```bash
seid tx staking create-validator \
    --amount=1000000usei \
    --pubkey=$(seid tendermint show-validator) \
    --moniker="choose_moniker" \
    --chain-id=sei-chain \
    --commission-rate="0.10" \
    --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
    --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
    --min-self-delegation="1" \
    --gas="auto" \
    --gas-adjustment="1.5" \
    --gas-prices="0.01usei" \
    --from=operator
```

The commission parameters deserve careful consideration:

- `commission-rate`: Your initial commission rate
- `commission-max-rate`: An upper limit that can never be exceeded
- `commission-max-change-rate`: Maximum daily commission change

## Oracle Price Feeder Setup

As a Sei validator, you must run a price feeder to provide oracle data. This is crucial for network operations.

First, install the price feeder:

```bash
cd sei-chain
make install-price-feeder
```

Create a configuration file for your price feeder:

<details>
<summary>Price Feeder Configuration</summary>

```toml
gas_adjustment = 1.5
gas_prices = "0.01usei"
enable_server = true
enable_voter = true
provider_timeout = "500ms"

[server]
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:7171"
read_timeout = "20s"
verbose_cors = true
write_timeout = "20s"

[keyring]
backend = "file"
dir = "/home/sei/.sei"

[rpc]
grpc_endpoint = "localhost:9090"
rpc_timeout = "500ms"
tmrpc_endpoint = "http://localhost:26657"

[telemetry]
enable_hostname = true
enable_hostname_label = true
enable_service_label = true
prometheus_retention = 120
service_name = "price-feeder"

[[provider_endpoints]]
name = "binance"
rest = "https://api1.binance.com"
websocket = "stream.binance.com:9443"
```

</details>

Start the price feeder as a service:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/price-feeder.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=Sei Price Feeder
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which price-feeder) /path/to/config.toml
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable price-feeder
sudo systemctl start price-feeder
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Validator-Specific Metrics

Beyond basic node monitoring, validators should track additional metrics:

```bash
# Check validator status
seid query staking validator $(seid keys show -a $VALIDATOR_KEY)

# Monitor signing status
seid query slashing signing-info $(seid tendermint show-validator)

# Check current delegations
seid query staking delegations-to $(seid keys show -a $VALIDATOR_KEY)
```

### Alert Configuration

Set up critical alerts for validator operations. Here are essential Prometheus alert rules:

<details>
<summary>Validator Alert Rules</summary>

```yaml
groups:
  - name: validator_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: ValidatorMissedBlocks
        expr: increase(tendermint_consensus_validator_missed_blocks[1h]) > 0
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: 'Validator missing blocks'

      - alert: ValidatorJailed
        expr: tendermint_consensus_validator_status == 0
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: 'Validator has been jailed'

      - alert: OraclePriceFeedDelay
        expr: time() - sei_oracle_price_timestamp > 300
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: 'Oracle price feed delayed'
```

</details>

## Security Practices

### Network Security

Implement a sentry node architecture to protect your validator:

```bash
# Validator node config.toml
[p2p]
pex = false
persistent_peers = "sentry_node_id@sentry_node_ip:26656"
private_peer_ids = ""
addr_book_strict = false

# Sentry node config.toml
[p2p]
pex = true
private_peer_ids = "validator_node_id"
addr_book_strict = true
```

### Key Management Practices

Implement secure key backup procedures:

<details>
<summary>Key Backup Script</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create encrypted backup of validator keys
BACKUP_DIR="/secure/validator/backup"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Backup validator key
tar czf - $HOME/.sei/config/priv_validator_key.json | \
    gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 \
    -o $BACKUP_DIR/validator_key_$DATE.tar.gz.gpg

# Backup keyring
tar czf - $HOME/.sei/keyring-file | \
    gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 \
    -o $BACKUP_DIR/keyring_$DATE.tar.gz.gpg

# Create SHA256 checksums
sha256sum $BACKUP_DIR/*.gpg > $BACKUP_DIR/checksums_$DATE.txt
```

</details>

## Maintenance Procedures

### Planned Maintenance

When performing planned maintenance:

```bash
# Notify delegators (recommended at least 24h in advance)
# Consider posting to:
# - Chain governance forum
# - Social media channels
# - Validator website

# Gracefully stop the validator
sudo systemctl stop seid

# Perform maintenance tasks

# Restart services
sudo systemctl start seid
sudo systemctl start price-feeder
```

### Emergency Procedures

Create an emergency response plan:

<details>
<summary>Emergency Response Procedures</summary>

```bash
# 1. If double-signing is detected:
sudo systemctl stop seid
# Investigate priv_validator_state.json
# Contact team and delegators

# 2. If node is stuck:
seid status
# Check for consensus failures
journalctl -u seid -n 100
# Attempt safe restart
sudo systemctl restart seid

# 3. If oracle feed fails:
systemctl status price-feeder
# Check price-feeder logs
journalctl -u price-feeder -n 100
# Restart if necessary
sudo systemctl restart price-feeder
```

</details>

## Governance Participation

As a validator, you have a responsibility to participate in governance. Monitor and vote on proposals:

```bash
# List active proposals
seid query gov proposals --status voting_period

# Vote on a proposal
seid tx gov vote 1 yes \
    --from operator \
    --chain-id sei-chain \
    --gas auto \
    --gas-prices 0.01usei
```

## Validator Economics

Understanding validator economics is crucial for long-term success:

- Commission Rate Strategy: Set competitive rates while ensuring operational sustainability
- Delegation Management: Maintain good delegator relationships through transparent communication
- Reward Distribution: Rewards are distributed in real-time as blocks are produced
- Slashing Risks: Understand and mitigate risks of slashing through proper operation

## Recovery Procedures

### Validator Recovery

If you need to recover your validator on a new machine:

```bash
# 1. Set up new machine with Sei node
# 2. Copy secured backup files
# 3. Restore validator key
gpg -d validator_key_backup.tar.gz.gpg | tar xzf -
# 4. Restore keyring
gpg -d keyring_backup.tar.gz.gpg | tar xzf -
# 5. Start services
sudo systemctl start seid
sudo systemctl start price-feeder
```

This guide provides a foundation for operating a Sei validator. Remember that validator operation requires constant attention to security, performance, and network participation. Stay engaged with the Sei community and keep updated with network developments.
