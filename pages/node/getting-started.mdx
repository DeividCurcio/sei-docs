# Getting Started with Sei

This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to running a Sei node, whether you're setting up a full node or planning to become a validator. We'll cover both quick start options for testing and detailed setup procedures for production environments.

## System Requirements

Before beginning your Sei node setup, ensure your system meets these minimum requirements:

### Hardware Specifications

| Component | Minimum      | Recommended  | Notes                                                      |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU       | 8 cores      | 16 cores     | Modern processor (Intel Xeon/Core i7/i9 or AMD Epyc/Ryzen) |
| RAM       | 32GB         | 64GB         | DDR4 or better                                             |
| Storage   | 1TB NVMe SSD | 2TB NVMe SSD | High IOPS required; standard SSDs not recommended          |
| Network   | 1Gbps        | 2Gbps        | Low latency connection                                     |

### Base System Setup

Start with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later and install these essential packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install make gcc git jq chrony curl lz4 wget tar build-essential -y
```

## Quick Start Options

### 1. Automated Setup Script (Development/Testing)

For rapid deployment or testing environments, use our automated setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain
cd sei-chain
python3 scripts/run-node.py
```

The script will guide you through selecting:

- Network (mainnet, testnet, or local)
- Database backend (sei-db recommended)
- Basic configuration options

### 2. Production Setup Overview

For production environments, follow these steps in order:

1. Install Sei binary
2. Configure your node
3. Initialize the chain
4. Start the service

#### Install Sei Binary

Choose one of these installation methods:

```bash
# Option 1: Pre-built binary
wget -O seid https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/releases/download/[version]/seid-[version]-linux-amd64
sudo mv seid /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/seid

# Option 2: Build from source
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain
cd sei-chain
git checkout [version]  # Check latest stable release
make install
```

#### Basic Configuration

Initialize your node:

```bash
# Set your node name
MONIKER="your-node-name"
CHAIN_ID="pacific-1"  # Use "atlantic-2" for testnet

# Initialize node
seid init $MONIKER --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```

Configure essential settings:

```bash
# Update minimum gas prices
sed -i 's/minimum-gas-prices = ""/minimum-gas-prices = "0.01usei"/g' ~/.sei/config/app.toml

# Enable Prometheus metrics
sed -i 's/prometheus = false/prometheus = true/g' ~/.sei/config/config.toml
```

#### Service Setup

Create a systemd service for automatic startup and recovery:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/seid.service > /dev/null << EOF
[Unit]
Description=Sei Node
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which seid) start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable seid
sudo systemctl start seid
```

## Verify Your Setup

Check node status:

```bash
# View sync status
seid status | jq .SyncInfo

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u seid -f -o cat

# Query node info
seid status | jq .NodeInfo
```

Your node is properly set up when:

- Sync status shows `catching_up: false`
- You see blocks being processed in the logs
- Node info shows correct chain ID and network connection

## Next Steps

After completing basic setup, consider:

1. Setting up monitoring and alerting
2. Implementing security best practices
3. Configuring backup procedures
4. Becoming a validator (if planned)

These topics are covered in detail in their respective guides:

- Advanced Configuration & Monitoring Guide
- Node Operations Guide
- Validator Operations Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Sync Issues

- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Check network connectivity
- Verify system time synchronization
- Consider using state sync for faster initial sync (**not applicable to archive nodes**)

### Performance Problems

- Monitor system resources
- Check disk I/O performance
- Ensure adequate network bandwidth
- Verify memory usage patterns

### Network Connectivity

- Configure firewall rules
- Check peer connections
- Verify DNS resolution
- Ensure required ports are open (26656, 26657, 9090)
