# IBC Relayer

## Overview

**Relayers** are permissionless off-chain processes that ferry data packets from
one chain to
another. [Relayer](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/technical-resource-catalog?category=Relayer#results)s
scan chain states, build transactions based on these states, and submit the
transactions to the chains involved in the network. Relayers play a crucial role
in IBC because chains do not directly send messages to each other over
networking infrastructure. Instead, they create and store the data to be
retrieved and used by a relayer to build IBC packets.

Get an in-depth walkthrough of the IBC components and packet flow on
the [developer documentation.](https://ibc.cosmos.network/v8/ibc/overview)

There are several relayer implementations in different languages:

- Golang [relayer](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer)
- Rust [hermes](https://hermes.informal.systems/)

## Running relayer with Sei

### Installation

We will be using hermes as example relayer. Please note, that Sei requires
hermes of version `1.3.0` .

To install hermes simply head to the
GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/releases) page and
download Hermes binary matching your platform:

- macOS: `hermes-v1.3.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` (or .zip),
- Linux: `hermes-v1.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` (or .zip).

The step-by-step instruction below should carry you through the whole process:

1. Make the directory where we'll place the binary:

```sh copy
mkdir -p $HOME/.hermes/bin
```

2. Extract the binary archive:

```sh copy
tar -C $HOME/.hermes/bin/ -vxzf $ARCHIVE_NAME
```

3. Update your path, by adding this line in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` shell
   configuration file:

```sh copy
export PATH="$HOME/.hermes/bin:$PATH"
```

The `Source code` [archive](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/archive/refs/tags/v1.3.0.tar.gz) also contains hermes documentation that you can follow in `guide/book` folder.

### Configuration

`$HOME/.hermes/config.toml` file should look like below. Please note that this example assumes local chains, so all RPC urls have to be substituted for real chain ones.
