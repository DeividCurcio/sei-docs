# Error Codes and Troubleshooting of Nodes

Understanding common errors and their solutions helps maintain a healthy node
operation.

## Common Error Codes

Here are the most frequent errors you might encounter and their solutions:

### Consensus Errors

When you encounter consensus errors, quick and appropriate action is essential:

```text copy
Error: "Consensus failure - height halted"
Solution: Check for network upgrades or chain halts
Command: seid status | jq .SyncInfo
```

```text copy
Error: "Private validator file not found"
Solution: Restore validator key or check file permissions
Location: $HOME/.sei/config/priv_validator_key.json
```

```text copy
Error: "Duplicate signature"
Solution: IMMEDIATELY STOP NODE - potential double signing risk
Action: Check validator operation on other machines
```

### Network Errors

Network errors can prevent your node from participating in consensus:

```text copy
Error: "Dial tcp connection refused"
Solution: Check network connectivity and firewall rules
Commands:
  - netstat -tulpn | grep seid
  - ufw status
```

```text copy
Error: "No peers available"
Solution: Verify peer connections and network config
Commands:

- curl localhost:26657/net_info
```

### Database Errors

Database corruption can require immediate attention:

```text copy
Error: "Database is corrupted"
Solution: Reset database or restore from backup
Commands:
  - seid tendermint unsafe-reset-all
  - cp -r backup/data $HOME/.sei/
```

### Diagnostic Commands

These commands help you investigate issues and monitor your node:

```bash copy
# Check node synchronization
seid status | jq '.sync_info'

# Check validator status
seid query staking validator $(seid tendermint show-validator)

# Monitor real-time logs
journalctl -fu seid -o cat

# View system resource usage
top -p $(pgrep seid)
```

## AppHash Mismatch Errors

If you encounter an AppHash mismatch, you'll need to capture the state for comparison with a known good version:

```bash copy
# For SeiDB (most non-archive nodes):
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-db.git
cd sei-db/tools
make install
systemctl stop seid
seidb dump-iavl -d $HOME/.sei/data/committer.db -o /home/ubuntu/iavl-dump
systemctl restart seid

# For Legacy IAVL DB:
seid debug dump-iavl <latest height>
```

Always include the app hash, commit hash, and block height from your logs when reporting issues.

## Crash and Panic Debugging

For crashes, panics, or nil pointer exceptions:

- Capture at least 1,000 lines of logs leading up to the crash
- Or collect 15 minutes of log data, whichever provides more context
- Include the full stack trace if available

### Logging Configuration

Proper logging configuration is essential for debugging and monitoring:

```toml copy
# In config.toml
# Set appropriate log level
log_level = "debug"  # Use "trace" for maximum detail

# Choose log format
log_format = "json"  # Use "plain" for human-readable logs
```

Configure log rotation to manage storage effectively:

```bash copy
# Example logrotate configuration
sudo tee /etc/logrotate.d/seid << EOF
/var/log/seid/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 14
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 0640 sei sei
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        systemctl reload seid
    endscript
}
EOF
```

Enable core dumps for crash analysis:

```bash copy
# Set unlimited core dump size
ulimit -c unlimited

# Configure core dump location
echo "/tmp/core.%e.%p" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
```

## Other common Issues and Fixes

1. **Sync Problems**

   - Check available disk space (`df -h`)
   - Ensure proper peer connections (`curl http://localhost:26657/net_info`)
   - Verify firewall settings (port 26656 open)

2. **Performance Issues**

   - Monitor system resources (`htop` or `iotop`)
   - Check disk I/O performance (`iostat`)
   - Analyze network traffic (`iftop`)

3. **Database Issues**

   - Run database integrity checks using:

     ```bash copy
     seid debug dump-db | grep -i error
     ```

     If errors are detected, consider restoring from a recent backup.

   - Consider pruning excessive historical data by adjusting `ss-keep-recent` in
     `app.toml` or running:

     ```bash copy
     seid unsafe-reset-all --home=$HOME/.sei --keep-addr-book
     ```

     Alternatively, manually remove old state snapshots to free up space:

     ```bash copy
     rm -rf $HOME/.sei/data/snapshots/*
     ```

## Node Rollback

To rollback a node from an AppHashed state, you need to stop the node first.
Do this in your preferred way.

Next, do a soft rollback with:

```bash
seid rollback
```

And then a hard rollback with:

```bash
seid rollback --hard
```

Then, restart the node.

In case you see the following error while trying to rollback:

```bash
failed to initialize database: resource temporarily unavailable
```

This means that you did not shutdown the node properly. Try to shutdown or kill the `seid` process directly in that case. If this doesn't help, restart your machine.

Then try the rollback steps again.
