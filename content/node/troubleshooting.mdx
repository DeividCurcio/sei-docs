# Error Codes and Troubleshooting of Nodes

Understanding common errors and their solutions helps maintain a healthy node
operation.

## Common Error Codes

Here are the most frequent errors you might encounter and their solutions:

### Consensus Errors

When you encounter consensus errors, quick and appropriate action is essential:

```text copy
Error: "Consensus failure - height halted"
Solution: Check for network upgrades or chain halts
Command: seid status | jq .SyncInfo
```

```text copy
Error: "Private validator file not found"
Solution: Restore validator key or check file permissions
Location: $HOME/.sei/config/priv_validator_key.json
```

```text copy
Error: "Duplicate signature"
Solution: IMMEDIATELY STOP NODE - potential double signing risk
Action: Check validator operation on other machines
```

### Network Errors

Network errors can prevent your node from participating in consensus:

```text copy
Error: "Dial tcp connection refused"
Solution: Check network connectivity and firewall rules
Commands:
  - netstat -tulpn | grep seid
  - ufw status
```

```text copy
Error: "No peers available"
Solution: Verify peer connections and network config
Commands:

- curl localhost:26657/net_info
```

#### Database Errors

Database corruption can require immediate attention:

```text copy
Error: "Database is corrupted"
Solution: Reset database or restore from backup
Commands:
  - seid tendermint unsafe-reset-all
  - cp -r backup/data $HOME/.sei/
```

### Diagnostic Commands

These commands help you investigate issues and monitor your node:

```bash copy
# Check node synchronization
seid status | jq '.sync_info'

# Check validator status
seid query staking validator $(seid tendermint show-validator)

# Monitor real-time logs
journalctl -u seid -f -o cat

# View system resource usage
top -p $(pgrep seid)
```

### Other common Issues and Fixes

1. **Sync Problems**

   - Check available disk space (`df -h`)
   - Ensure proper peer connections (`curl http://localhost:26657/net_info`)
   - Verify firewall settings (port 26656 open)

2. **Performance Issues**

   - Monitor system resources (`htop` or `iotop`)
   - Check disk I/O performance (`iostat`)
   - Analyze network traffic (`iftop`)

3. **Database Issues**

   - Run database integrity checks using:

     ```bash copy
     seid debug dump-db | grep -i error
     ```

     If errors are detected, consider restoring from a recent backup.

   - Consider pruning excessive historical data by adjusting `ss-keep-recent` in
     `app.toml` or running:

     ```bash copy
     seid unsafe-reset-all --home=$HOME/.sei --keep-addr-book
     ```

     Alternatively, manually remove old state snapshots to free up space:

     ```bash copy
     rm -rf $HOME/.sei/data/snapshots/*
     ```

## Node Rollback

To rollback a node from an AppHashed state, you need to stop the node first.
Do this in your preferred way.

Next, do a soft rollback with:

```bash
seid rollback
```

And then a hard rollback with:

```bash
seid rollback --hard
```

Then, restart the node.

In case you see the following error while trying to rollback:

```bash
failed to initialize database: resource temporarily unavailable
```

This means that you did not shutdown the node properly. Try to shutdown or kill the `seid` process directly in that case. If this doesn't help, restart your machine.

Then try the rollback steps again.
