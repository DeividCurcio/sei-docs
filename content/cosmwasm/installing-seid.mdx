# Seid CLI

Seid is a command-line tool for interacting with the Sei blockchain. This page
will guide you through setting up Seid and introduce you to some basic commands
to get started.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19+: Installation instructions are available
  [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Installation

To install Seid, locate the version you wish to use
[here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/releases), and then execute the
following commands:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain
cd sei-chain
git checkout v4.1.4-evm-devnet
make install
```

You can verify that Seid was installed correctly by running:

```bash copy
seid version
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you encounter an error like `command not found: seid`, you may need to set your GOPATH environment variable.

1. Use `go env GOPATH` to find your GOPATH
2. Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash copy
   export GOPATH=[your GOPATH from step 1]
   export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
   ```

For more information see
[here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable).

Use "seid [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Adding a wallet

You can create a new wallet using the `seid keys` command:

```bash copy
seid keys add $NAME
```

Please replace `$NAME` with the name you would like to use for this key. This
will generate a seed phrase and store the account in the CLI for use. Write this
mnemonic down and store it in a safe place.

Alternatively, if you would like to import an existing seed phrase, you can add
the `--recover` flag:

```bash copy
seid keys add $NAME --recover
```

You will then be prompted to input your seed phrase.

<Callout type="warning">
    If you are importing from an EVM wallet like MetaMask, you may need to specify the coin type. Ethereum (EVM) based wallets use coin type `60`, while the default on Sei is `118`.
    For example,

    ```bash copy
    seid keys add $NAME --coin-type=60
    ```

This will generate a different address than the default coin type of `118`.

</Callout>

To see your local wallets, you can run

```bash copy
seid keys list
```

to see a list of all wallets added, or

```bash copy
seid keys show $NAME
```

to see a details about a specific wallet.

# Using `seid` CLI

You can query or send transactions to Sei easily via `seid` once you have the
`seid` command installed (see [Installing Seid](node/getting-started))

## Queries

If the machine you run these commands from are not running a node of the
network, you'll need to append `--node http://url-to-sei-cosmos-rpc` to your
command. Refer to the
[RPC Providers](/learn/rpc-providers) page for a list of
RPC endpoints.

- `seid q evm sei-addr [some EVM address]`: Gets the associated Sei address of
  the queried EVM address, if it exists on-chain.
- `seid q evm evm-addr [some Sei address]`: Gets the associated EVM address of
  the queried Sei address, if it exists on-chain.
- `seid q evm erc20 [erc20 address] [method] [arguments...]`: Query the ERC20
  contract at given address using the given method/arguments.
- `seid q evm payload [abi-filepath] [method] [arguments...]`: Generate the
  hexadecimal payload of the requested method call given an ABI.
- `seid q evm pointer [type] [pointee]`: Gets the pointer contract of the
  requested pointee. The `type` parameter can be one of "NATIVE", "CW20",
  "CW721", "ERC20", or "ERC721", and `pointee` is the target contract address.
  For "NATIVE" type, `pointee` would be the native denom name instead.

## Transactions

Sending transactions via CLI requires you to have keys added via
`seid keys add`. You can then specify the key you want to use by appending
`--from=[key name]` to your command.

If the machine you run these commands from are not a node of the network, you'd
need to append `--evm-rpc http://url-to-sei-evm-rpc` to your command. Refer to
the [RPC Providers](/learn/rpc-providers) page for a list
of RPC endpoints.

- `seid tx evm associate-address`: Associates the Sei address and EVM address
  on-chain for the sending key.
- `seid tx evm send [to EVM address] [amount in wei]`: Sends native tokens to
  the target EVM address.
- `seid tx evm deploy [path_to_binary]`: Deploys the EVM contract specified in
  `path_to_binary`.
- `seid tx evm call-contract [addr] [payload hex]`: Sends a transaction that
  calls contract at the target address with the provided payload.
- `seid tx evm erc20-send [addr] [recipient] [amount]`: Sends ERC20 tokens of
  contract at `addr` to the target recipient.
- `seid tx evm delegate [val-addr] [amount]`: Delegates specified amount to the
  target validator address. The validator address must be in Sei/Cosmos
  validator address format.
