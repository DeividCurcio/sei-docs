## 1.) Get a Wallet

Download a compatible, wallet, such as [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/), [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or any other [supported wallet](/learn/wallets).

## 2.) Set Up and Link Your Wallet

Some wallets may not have Sei enabled by default, to add it, simply connect your wallet below and it will prompt you to switch networks. Additionally, if using CosmWasm (some protocols and exchanges), your EVM and Sei addresses will be linked automatically.
