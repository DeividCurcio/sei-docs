# About Sei

Parallel execution, high throughput and standard EVM interface establish Sei as
the leader in scalable and interconnected blockchain ecosystems.

Sei’s twin-turbo consensus and SeiDB achieve 380 millisecond block times and
deliver transaction throughput tailored for high-demand blockchain environments.
Advancements in performance position Sei as a pivotal force in
cross-disciplinary distributed computing and redefine EVM capabilities. The
design enables complex real-world decentralized applications and sets a new
benchmark for blockchain technology.

Sei’s architecture offers seamless interoperability and gives EVM developers
native access to the Cosmos ecosystem with IBC tokens, multi-sig accounts and
fee grants. Precompile Contracts bridge EVM and Cosmos-SDK modules
and enable smooth interaction with assets ranging from ERC20 to CW20 tokens and
CW721 to ERC721 NFTs without sacrificing performance.
Pointer Contracts are a basic interface enabling standard EVM token functions to be used with Cosmos-SDK assets, CW20 and other contract based tokens.
Integrating IBC and Cosmwasm
directly into the EVM through Precompile Contracts strengthens cross-VM
functionality.

## Sei performance metrics

With these performance optimizations, Sei is able to get

- 380 millisecond time to finality
- 5,030 transactions per second (12,500 theoretical max)

## What optimizations does Sei introduce?

Sei introduces four major innovations:

- **Twin Turbo Consensus**: This feature allows Sei to reach the fastest time to
  finality of any blockchain at 380 ms, unlocking web2 like experiences for
  applications.
- **Optimistic Parallelization**: This feature allows developers to unlock
  parallel processing for their Ethereum applications, with no additional work such as defining dependencies in a smart contract.
- **SeiDB**: This major upgrade allows Sei to handle the much higher rate of
  data storage, reads and writes which become extremely important for a high
  performance blockchain.
- **Interoperable EVM**: This allows existing developers in the Ethereum
  ecosystem to deploy their applications, tooling and infrastructure to Sei with
  no changes, while benefiting from the 100x performance improvements offered by
  Sei.
