# Wallet Providers

Wallets are essential for managing assets and interacting with the Sei
blockchain. There are various types of wallets available, each offering
different features and levels of security.

> **Attention:** Manually importing your wallet using a mnemonic from an EVM-only wallet app to a Cosmos-based wallet app, or vice versa, is not recommended. This may generate unexpected wallet addresses due to differing [cointypes](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0044#Coin_type).

## Types of Wallets

1. **Software Wallets**: These are applications or browser extensions that
   manage private keys and interact with the blockchain. They are easy to use
   and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
2. **Hardware Wallets**: These are physical devices that securely store private
   keys offline. They provide enhanced security but are less convenient for
   frequent transactions.
3. **Passkey-based Wallets**: These wallets use passkeys for authentication
   instead of traditional seed phrases, offering an additional layer of
   security.
