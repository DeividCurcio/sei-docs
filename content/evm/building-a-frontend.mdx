# Frontend Development

Developing the frontend of a dApp on Sei involves connecting to wallets,
interacting with the blockchain via RPC endpoints, and signing and broadcasting
transactions.

In this section, we'll explore Sei's unique interoperability features by building an EVM compatible DApp that interacts with a CosmWasm smart contract.
We will use [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) to build a React app that interacts with a CosmWasm smart contract using the Sei [CosmWasm precompile](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/tree/main/precompiles/wasmd).

### EVM and EVM RPC dApps:

- **Wagmi**: A React-based library for Ethereum dApps that simplifies wallet
  connection and interaction. Provides hooks for interacting with Ethereum
  wallets and contracts for use with modern frontend libraries and frameworks.
- [Wagmi Documentation](https://wagmi.sh/)
- **Viem**: A lightweight and flexible library for Ethereum development.
- [Viem Documentation](https://viem.sh/docs/getting-started)
- **Ethers.js**: A complete and compact library for interacting with the
  Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem. Known for its simplicity and extensive
  functionality.
- [Ethers.js Documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v6/)

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Node.js & NPM installed
- One of the Sei wallets listed [here](/learn/wallets)

## Creating a React Project

Start by creating a new React project using Vite's TypeScript template for
streamlined development:

    ```bash copy
    npm create vite@latest my-counter-frontend -- --template react-ts
    ```

This command creates a new folder with a React project using TypeScript. Open
`my-counter-frontend` in your favorite IDE.

<Callout type="info">The rest of this tutorial will be in TypeScript. If you're not using TypeScript, you can easily adjust by removing the types.</Callout>

## Installing Dependencies

Install `ethers`, an Ethereum library that facilitates interaction with the
Ethereum blockchain:

    ```bash copy
    npm install ethers
    ```

## Defining Contract Addresses and ABI

In this tutorial, we will be using the **Wasm Precompile** to interact with our
CosmWasm contract from the EVM. Precompiles (short for Precompiled contracts)
are EVM compatible contracts that are built into the chain.
The Wasm Precompile
is a unique smart contract on Sei that enables EVM clients to query and execute
CosmWasm contracts. Refer to the docs on
[precompiles](/evm/precompiles/example-usage) for
more details.

First, import the address and ABI of the CosmWasm precompile from `@sei-js/evm`.

<Callout type="info">`@sei-js` contains NPM libraries for writing applications that interact with Sei. Learn more [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-js/tree/main).</Callout>

`@sei-js/evm` is an npm package that contains useful constants and helpers for
interacting with the EVM on Sei.

To install sei-js:

    ```bash copy
    npm install @sei-js/evm
    ```

At the top of `App.tsx` you can then import `WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS`,
`WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI`. These constants allow us to interact with the Wasm
Precompile.

    ```tsx copy
    import { WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI, WasmPrecompileContract } from '@sei-js/evm';
    import { ethers } from 'ethers';
    ```

These values will be used in the app to query and execute a contract.

## Connecting to the Wallet and Initializing the Contract

Replace your main `App` component with the following:

    ```tsx copy filename="App.tsx"
    import { WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, SEI_CHAIN_INFO, getWasmPrecompileEthersV6Contract } from '@sei-js/evm';
    import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
    import { BrowserProvider, Contract, toUtf8Bytes, toUtf8String } from 'ethers';
    import './App.css';

    function App() {
    	const [count, setCount] = useState<string>();
    	const [contract, setContract] = useState<Contract>();
    	const [isIncrementing, setIsIncrementing] = useState(false);

    	// TODO: Replace this with your CosmWasm contract address here
    	const COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'sei14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sh9m79m';

    	const fetchCount = async () => {
    		if (!contract) {
    			return;
    		}
    		// Query to get the count on the counter contract
    		const queryMsg = { get_count: {} };
    		const queryResponse = await contract.query(COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryMsg)));
    		const { count } = JSON.parse(toUtf8String(queryResponse));
    		setCount(count);
    	};

    	useEffect(() => {
    		fetchCount();
    	}, [contract]);

    	const connectWallet = async () => {
    		if (window.ethereum) {
    			const provider = new BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
    			const { chainId } = await provider.getNetwork();
    			const devnetChainId = SEI_CHAIN_INFO.devnet.chainId;
    			if (chainId !== BigInt(devnetChainId)) {
    				alert('Wallet is not connected to Sei EVM devnet');
    				return;
    			}

    			const signer = await provider.getSigner();
    			const contract = getWasmPrecompileEthersV6Contract(signer);

    			setContract(contract);
    		} else {
    			alert('No EVM compatible wallet installed');
    		}
    	};

    	const incrementCount = async () => {
    		if (!contract) {
    			return;
    		}

    		setIsIncrementing(true);
    		// Execute message to increment the count on the contract
    		const executeMsg = { increment: {} };
    		const executeResponse = await contract.execute(
    			COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    			toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(executeMsg)),
    			toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify([])) // Used for sending funds if needed
    		);
    		// Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
    		await executeResponse.wait();
    		console.log(executeResponse);
    		setIsIncrementing(false);
    		await fetchCount();
    	};

    	return (
    		<>
    			<div className="card">
    				{contract ? (
    					<div>
    						<h1>Count is {count}</h1>
    						<button disabled={isIncrementing} onClick={incrementCount}>
    							{isIncrementing ? 'incrementing...' : 'increment'}
    						</button>
    					</div>
    				) : (
    					<button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>
    				)}
    			</div>
    		</>
    	);
    }

    export default App;
    ```

### Detailed outline of `App.tsx`

**State Declarations**

- `count`: Holds the current count fetched from the smart contract.
- `contract`: An instance of the ethers Contract object, used for interacting
  with the blockchain.
- `isIncrementing`: A boolean to manage UI state during contract execution

**Effect Hooks**

A single `useEffect` hook to fetch the current count whenever the contract state
changes, indicating that the contract instance is ready for interaction.

**Connecting to EVM Wallet**

A function named `connectWallet` that:

- Checks for any EVM compatible wallet extension.
- Establishes a connection to the Ethereum network via the connected wallet,
  using ethers.js BrowserProvider.
- Verifies the correct network (Sei EVM devnet) by comparing chainId.
- Creates an ethers.js Contract instance with the signer from the wallet,
  setting it in the contract state for later use.

**Fetching Contract Data**

A function named `fetchCount` that:

- Executes a contract query to get the current count.
- Parses and updates the count state with the response.

**Incrementing the Counter**

A function named `incrementCount` that:

- Sends a transaction to the smart contract to increment the count.
- Waits for the transaction to be confirmed.
- Refetches the count to update the UI with the new value.

To see your app in action, run `npm run dev` to spin up a local version of the
application. Once you connect your wallet, you should see a counter, as well as
a button you can use to increment the counter on the contract.

Congrats on deploying your first interoperable dApp on Sei!

### Polyfills Warning

When developing frontend applications for the blockchain, it's important to be
aware that some libraries may require polyfills, especially when used in browser
environments. For instance, the `Buffer` class and other Node.js-specific
features are not natively available in browsers and need to be polyfilled.

If you are using Vite or another rollup based frontend library you can add the
following to the entry point of your app.

```tsx copy
import { Buffer } from 'buffer';

// Polyfill self for browser and global for Node.js
const globalObject = typeof self !== 'undefined' ? self : global;

Object.assign(globalObject, {
  process: process,
  Buffer: Buffer
});
```

If you are using a Webpack based bundling tool you can use the following plugin
in you Webpack config.

```
yarn add -D node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
```

```tsx copy
import NodePolyfillPlugin from 'node-polyfill-webpack-plugin';

... // the rest of your webpack config
plugins: [
    ...
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    ...
],
...
```
