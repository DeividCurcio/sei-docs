Sei Global Wallet is a cross-application embedded crypto wallet powered by [Dynamic Global Wallets](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/global-wallets/overview). It gives users a persistent wallet experience across any integrated app within the Sei ecosystem, allowing them to authenticate and interact using familiar login methods like email, X, or Telegram—no browser extension or prior crypto knowledge required.

For developers, integration is intentionally lightweight. If you're using EIP-6963-compatible libraries such as RainbowKit, WalletConnectKit, or Dynamic, setup takes only a few lines of code. You'll need to import the wallet package and wrap your provider stack with the appropriate global wallet components to fully activate functionality.

### Benefits of the Sei Global Wallet

- Streamlined onboarding with familiar web2 login methods (email, Google, X, Telegram)
- Seamless access across all integrated Sei ecosystem apps
- No browser extension or crypto wallet installation required
- Fully self-custodial: user controls private keys at all times
- Simple integration via RainbowKit, WalletConnect, or Dynamic
- Compatibility with existing wallet apps (e.g. MetaMask, Trust, WalletConnect, Coinbase) can be enabled if there is demand
- Supports secure, popup-based interactions for transaction signing and authentication with active prevention of common hijacking methods

## EIP-6963

EIP-6963 is a standardized communication protocol for embedded wallets, enabling seamless cross-application
interoperability in the web3 ecosystem. It defines a common API for:

- **Wallet Discovery & Pairing:** Allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to locate and securely connect with embedded wallets.
- **Authentication & Session Management:** Facilitating unified login experiences and secure authentication across multiple apps.
- **Transaction Signing:** Providing a consistent method for users to sign transactions through their embedded wallets.

## Installation

1. **Install Sei Global Wallet Package**

   ```bash copy
   yarn add @sei-js/sei-global-wallet
   ```
   or
   ```bash copy
   npm install @sei-js/sei-global-wallet
   ```

2. **Importing the Sei Global Wallet**

   To use this wallet with any wallet provider that supports the EIP-6963 standard, you must import the wallet
   package in your project:

   ```javascript copy
   import "@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963";
   ```

   **Note:** Importing the package alone does not activate the global wallet functionality. You must also
   wrap your provider stack with the necessary global wallet provider components (e.g. DynamicContextProvider
   and DynamicWagmiConnector).

3. **Use Sei Global Wallet**

   Wrap your app’s existing providers with the global wallet providers to enable all required functionality.

## Integration Examples

Sei Global Wallet support can be added to most applications using various popular libraries. The key is to wrap your
provider stack with the global wallet providers. Here are examples demonstrating integrations using **Generic (Dynamic/Wagmi)**,
**Dynamic (Next.js)**, **WalletConnectKit**, and **RainbowKit**.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Generic (Dynamic/Wagmi)</strong></summary>

  ```tsx copy filename="Web3Provider.tsx"
  import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
  import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
  import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools';
  import type { ReactNode } from 'react';
  import { http, WagmiProvider, createConfig } from 'wagmi';

  import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from '@dynamic-labs/ethereum';
  import { DynamicContextProvider, RemoveWallets, SortWallets } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core';
  import { DynamicWagmiConnector } from '@dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector';
  import { pipe } from '@dynamic-labs/utils';
  import { useComputedColorScheme } from '@mantine/core';

  // Import the global wallet implementation
  import '@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963';
  import { sei, seiTestnet, seiDevnet } from 'viem/chains';

  const queryClient = new QueryClient();

  interface Web3ProviderProps {
    children: ReactNode;
  }

  function Web3Provider({ children }: Web3ProviderProps) {
    const colorScheme = useComputedColorScheme();

    // Buffer polyfill for browser environments
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      window.Buffer = window.Buffer ?? Buffer;
    }

    const config = createConfig({
      chains: [sei, seiDevnet, seiTestnet],
      multiInjectedProviderDiscovery: false,
      transports: {
        [sei.id]: http(),
        [seiDevnet.id]: http(),
        [seiTestnet.id]: http(),
      },
    });

    return (
      <DynamicContextProvider
        theme={colorScheme === 'dark' ? 'dark' : 'light'}
        settings={{
          environmentId: '<env_id>',
          walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors],
          walletsFilter: pipe(SortWallets(['metamask', 'okxwallet', 'rabby', 'compasswallet', 'coinbase'])).pipe(RemoveWallets(['phantomevm'])),
        }}
      >
        <WagmiProvider config={config}>
          <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
            <DynamicWagmiConnector>{children}</DynamicWagmiConnector>
            <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
          </QueryClientProvider>
        </WagmiProvider>
      </DynamicContextProvider>
    );
  }

  export default Web3Provider;
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - **Global Wallet Wrapping:**  
    The global wallet functionality is activated by wrapping the providers with `DynamicContextProvider` and
    `DynamicWagmiConnector`. This injects all the required context for the embedded wallet.
  
  - **Provider Stack:**  
    The example uses `WagmiProvider` for blockchain connections and `QueryClientProvider` for managing async state,
    all nested inside the global wallet providers.
  ```

  <summary><strong>Dynamic (Next.js)</strong></summary>

  ```tsx copy filename="layout.tsx"
  "use client";

  import "./globals.css";
  import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
  import Providers from "@/lib/providers";

  const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

  // Import the global wallet implementation
  import '@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963';

  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: {
    children: React.ReactNode;
  }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <body className={inter.className}>
          <Providers>{children}</Providers>
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```
  
  **Note:** In this Dynamic example the global wallet provider wrapping is handled inside the
  `Providers` component.

Sei Global Wallets support an extensive list of social logins, such as email, Google, X, and Telegram.

#### Q: Do Sei Global Wallets conform to EIP standards?

Yes, Sei Global Wallets conform to a specific EIP standard (EIP-6963) for injecting wallets, ensuring compatibility
with aggregated wallet services like RainbowKit and ConnectKit.

#### Q: How do the security considerations of a Sei Global Wallet differ from traditional wallets?

Unlike traditional wallets, which often rely on client-side storage of private keys, Sei Global Wallets prioritize
secure, encrypted interactions. Key differences include:

- **Secure encrypted communication:** All communication between an application and the Sei Global Wallet pop-up is
  encrypted, ensuring that sensitive data is never exposed during transmission. Decryption only happens within
  the wallet pop-up, and private keys remain secure.
- **Protection against replay attacks:** Encrypted messaging eliminates opportunities for replay attacks,
  preventing intercepted data from being maliciously reused.
- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):** Encryption and decryption operations occur within secure TEEs,
  preventing unauthorized access. Even Dynamic—the wallet provider—never has access to the private keys.
- **Verified origins:** Only verified origins can interact with Sei Global Wallets, ensuring all transactions come from trusted sources.

In addition to these measures, Dynamic-powered embedded wallets maintain non-custodial security, ensuring that only the user controls their private keys. Dynamic’s multi-layered security architecture includes encrypted key storage, third-party audits, and continuous bug bounty programs.

#### Q: Are Sei Global Wallets self-custodial or custodial?

Sei Global Wallets and all Dynamic embedded wallets are self-custodial, giving full control and ownership to the end-user. Users can export their keys at any time and import them into other wallets, such as MetaMask.

#### Q: Do Sei Global Wallets require browser extensions?

No, they do not require browser extensions. They operate as embedded wallets that travel across the Sei ecosystem.

#### Q: Can I link my existing external wallet to my Sei Global Wallet?

Not at the moment. In the future, you will be able to link external wallets to a Sei global account.

#### Q: Can I put extra protections on my Sei Global Wallet?

While Global Wallets are self-custodial, we recommend practicing good security hygiene:
- **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra authentication layer for sensitive actions.
- **Be cautious of phishing attempts:** Verify security codes and sources before sharing any sensitive information.
- **Add backup options:** Link additional email or social login methods to ensure account recovery if needed.
