<Callout type="error">By logging in with Sei Global Wallet, you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://app.sei.io/terms)</Callout>

Sei Global Wallet is a cross-application embedded crypto wallet powered by [Dynamic Global Wallets](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/global-wallets/overview). It gives users a persistent wallet experience across any integrated app within the Sei ecosystem, allowing them to authenticate and interact using familiar login methods like Google, Twitter, or Telegram—no browser extension or prior crypto knowledge required.  
[*Other auth methods exist, but are not enabled at this time*]

Integration is as lightweight as possible. Using EIP-6963-compatible libraries such as RainbowKit, WalletConnectKit, or Dynamic, setup requires only a few lines of code. Simply import the wallet package and wrap your provider stack appropriately.

## Installation
1. **Install Sei Global Wallet Package**
```bash copy
yarn add @sei-js/sei-global-wallet
```
or
```bash copy
npm install @sei-js/sei-global-wallet
```

2. **Importing Sei Global Wallet**
Import the custom wallet:
```js copy
import "@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963";
```
> **Important:** Simply importing the package is not enough. Ensure you wrap your provider stack with appropriate global wallet components.

---

## Integration Examples
Provided below are several integration examples demonstrating several setups ranigng from basic to slightly advanced - using Dynamic, Wagmi, WalletConnectKit, RainbowKit, or Web3-react.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Dynamic (Next.js)</strong></summary>

**Note:** In this Dynamic example the global wallet provider wrapping is handled inside the
`Providers` component, which would include the DynamicContextProvider.

```tsx copy filename="layout.tsx"
"use client";

import "./globals.css";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import Providers from "@/lib/providers";
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

// Import the global wallet implementation
import '@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963';

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        {/* The Providers component wraps your app with the Dynamic context */}
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Wagmi with Dynamic</strong></summary>

```tsx copy filename="Web3Provider.tsx"
// Import required dependencies
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { http, WagmiProvider, createConfig } from 'wagmi';
import { sei, seiTestnet } from 'viem/chains';

// Import Dynamic-specific components
import { DynamicContextProvider } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core';
import { DynamicWagmiConnector } from '@dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector';

// Import the global wallet implementation
import '@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963';

// Create query client for React Query
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function Web3Provider({ children }) {
  // Create Wagmi configuration
  const config = createConfig({
    chains: [sei, seiTestnet],
    transports: {
      [sei.id]: http(),
      [seiTestnet.id]: http(),
    },
  });
  
  return (
    // Step 1: Wrap with DynamicContextProvider
    <DynamicContextProvider
      settings={{
        // Your Dynamic environment ID
        environmentId: '<env_id>',
      }}
    >
      {/* Step 2: Add Wagmi provider */}
      <WagmiProvider config={config}>
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
          {/* Step 3: Connect Dynamic to Wagmi */}
          <DynamicWagmiConnector>
            {children}
          </DynamicWagmiConnector>
        </QueryClientProvider>
      </WagmiProvider>
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}

export default Web3Provider;
```

**Explanation:**
- The global wallet is integrated by wrapping providers with `DynamicContextProvider` and `DynamicWagmiConnector`
- This example shows a simplified integration between Wagmi and Dynamic
- Be mindful of the nesting order - it is important: Dynamic → Wagmi → QueryClient → DynamicWagmiConnector

  <summary><strong>web3‑react (hook‑based)</strong></summary>

```tsx copy filename="src/App.web3react.tsx"
// Register the Sei Global Wallet under EIP‑6963 discovery
import '@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963'

import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { Web3ReactProvider, useWeb3React } from '@web3-react/core'
import { EIP1193Connector } from '@web3-react/eip1193'
import { Web3Provider as EthersProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers'

// Create a connector that auto‑discovers EIP‑6963 providers
const eip6963 = new EIP1193Connector()

// Wrap your app in Web3ReactProvider, supplying an ethers.js getLibrary fn
function getLibrary(provider: any): EthersProvider {
  return new EthersProvider(provider)
}

function InnerApp() {
  const { activate, active, account, library, error } = useWeb3React()

  // Auto‑connect on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    activate(eip6963).catch((err) => {
      console.error('Failed to connect Sei Global Wallet', err)
    })
  }, [activate])

  if (error) {
    return <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>Error: {error.message}</div>
  }
  if (!active) {
    return <div>Connecting to Sei Global Wallet…</div>
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>✅ Connected!</h2>
      <p>Account: <code>{account}</code></p>
      <p>Chain ID: <code>{library?.network?.chainId}</code></p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Web3ReactProvider getLibrary={getLibrary}>
      <InnerApp />
    </Web3ReactProvider>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Global‑wallet shim:** Importing `@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963` registers the wallet under the standard EIP‑6963 discovery events.  
- **EIP‑1193 connector:** `@web3-react/eip1193` listens for those events and exposes any injected providers via `activate(connector)`.  
- **Hook‑based flow:** Wrapping in `Web3ReactProvider` and calling `activate(eip6963)` on mount gives you a familiar hook API (`useWeb3React`) and an `ethers.js` provider.  

#### Sei Global Wallet as an Exclusive option

```ts
const seiConnector = new EIP1193Connector({
  getProvider: () => {
    const all = (window as any).eip6963Providers as Array<{
      info: { name: string }
      provider: any
    }>
    const found = all.find((d) => d.info.name === 'Sei Global Wallet')
    if (!found) throw new Error('Sei Global Wallet not found')
    return found.provider
  },
})
// then: activate(seiConnector)
```

## FAQ

#### Q: What are Sei Global Wallets?
Sei Global Wallets are an embedded wallet experience for the Sei network, enabling wallet creation and authentication through social logins. Unlike traditional embedded wallets, Sei Global Wallets offer greater flexibility by allowing users to carry their wallets across different apps within the Sei ecosystem. They also enable Sei to integrate as a login method across ecosystem apps.

#### Q: What are the key benefits of Sei Global Wallets for developers and users?

**For Developers:**
- **Sei ecosystem front and center:** Developers can add Sei as a login method to their app ("Log in with Sei"), enhancing brand visibility and creating a unified user experience across the Sei ecosystem.
- **Simple integration:** The Global Wallet Kit is compatible with tools like RainbowKit, ConnectKit, and Appkit, simplifying the process for developers to integrate Sei Global Wallets into their applications.
- **Enhanced security:** The kit provides robust security features, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and secure key management.

**For Users:**
- **Simplified onboarding:** Users can create wallets and authenticate using familiar social logins, eliminating the need for browser extensions or prior crypto knowledge.
- **Cross-app connectivity:** Users can navigate seamlessly across various applications within the Sei ecosystem using a single wallet, enhancing interoperability and user experience.
- **User-friendly flows:** Features like transaction simulation help users understand the impact of each transaction before confirmation, reducing risks and enhancing transparency.

#### Q: What login methods are currently supported?
Sei Global Wallets support an extensive list of social logins, such as email, Google, X, and Telegram.

#### Q: How do the security considerations of a Sei Global Wallet differ from traditional wallets?
Unlike traditional wallets, which often rely on full client-side storage of private keys, Sei Global Wallets prioritize secure, encrypted interactions. Key differences include:

- **Secure encrypted communication:** All communication between an application and the Sei Global Wallet pop-up is encrypted, ensuring that sensitive data is never exposed during transmission. Decryption only happens within the wallet pop-up, and private keys remain secure.
- **Protection against replay attacks:** Encrypted messaging eliminates opportunities for replay attacks, preventing intercepted data from being maliciously reused.
- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):** Encryption and decryption operations occur within secure TEEs, preventing unauthorized access. Even Dynamic—the wallet provider—never has access to the private keys.
- **Verified origins:** Only verified origins can interact with Sei Global Wallets, ensuring all transactions come from trusted sources.

In addition to these measures, Dynamic-powered embedded wallets maintain non-custodial security, ensuring that only the user controls their private keys. Dynamic's multi-layered security architecture includes encrypted key storage, third-party audits, and continuous bug bounty programs.

#### Q: Are Sei Global Wallets self-custodial or custodial?
Sei Global Wallets and all Dynamic embedded wallets are self-custodial, giving full control and ownership to the end-user. Users can export their keys at any time and import them into other wallets, such as MetaMask.

#### Q: Do Sei Global Wallets require browser extensions?
No, they do not require browser extensions. They operate as embedded wallets that travel across the Sei ecosystem.

#### Q: Can I link my existing external wallet to my Sei Global Wallet?
Not at the moment. In the future, you will be able to link external wallets to a Sei global account.

#### Q: Can I put extra protections on my Sei Global Wallet?
While Global Wallets are non-custodial, good security practices are always critical:
- **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra authentication layer for sensitive actions.
- **Be wary of phishing attempts:** Verify security codes and sources before sharing any sensitive information.
- **Always Have a Backup method:** Link additional email or social login methods to ensure account recovery if needed.
- **Do not store any authentication keys / phrases digitally:** No length or number of passwords can stop anyone with the private key from having full control over the wallet.

#### Q: Have Sei Global Wallets been audited?
Yes, the 'Global Wallets' product by Dynamic—has been audited by 'Cure53'.

#### Q: A user or developer has reported a bug, such as a UI issue. How should it be reported?
Please provide the following information:
- Device details
- Browser information
- A clear description of the issue
- If possible, a Loom video or screen recording
