Sei Global Wallet is a cross-application embedded crypto wallet powered by
[Dynamic Global Wallets](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/global-wallets/overview) that is accessed via conventional
login methods (i.e., email, X, Telegram). With Sei Global Wallet, users gain access to the same embedded wallet on any
integrated app within the Sei ecosystem-- enabling seamless onboarding without fragmenting liquidity
(or adding an extra deposit step) for your users.
Integrating is straightforward for developers using EIP-6963-compatible wallets or libraries like RainbowKit,
WalletConnectKit, or Dynamic. Our lightweight SDK allows to easily add Sei Global Wallet to your app with just a
few lines of code.

### Benefits of the Sei Global Wallet

- Simplifies onboarding for users
- Provides a seamless way for users to explore onchain apps without a browser extension or native app
- Allows developers to utilize a secure popup that is compatible with RainbowKit, WalletConnect, and Dynamic
- Offers users simple login flows without compromising access to liquidity
- Works across all dApps that use EIP-6963-compatible wallets or libraries

### Features
- Does not require a browser extension
- Login with email
- Social login (Google, X, Telegram)
- All existing wallets will work as well (e.g. Metamask, Trust, WalletConnect, Coinbase)

## EIP-6963
EIP-6963 is a standardized communication protocol for embedded wallets, enabling seamless cross-application
interoperability in the web3 ecosystem. It defines a common API for:

- Wallet Discovery & Pairing: Allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to locate and securely connect with embedded wallets.
- Authentication & Session Management: Facilitating unified login experiences and secure authentication across multiple apps.
- Transaction Signing: Providing a consistent method for users to sign transactions through their embedded wallets.

## FAQ

### General

#### Q: What are Sei Global Wallets?

Sei Global Wallets are an embedded wallet experience for the Sei network, enabling wallet creation and authentication
through social logins. Unlike traditional embedded wallets, Sei Global Wallets offer greater flexibility by allowing
users to carry their wallets across different apps within the Sei ecosystem. They also enable Sei to integrate
themselves as a login method across ecosystem apps.

#### Q: What are the key benefits of Sei Global Wallets for developers and users?

**For Developers:**
- **Sei ecosystem front and center:** Developers can add Sei as a login method to their app ("Log in with Sei"),
enhancing brand visibility and creating a unified user experience across the Sei ecosystem.
- **Simple integration:** The Global Wallet Kit is compatible with tools like RainbowKit, ConnectKit, and Appkit,
simplifying the process for developers to integrate Sei Global Wallets into their applications.
- **Enhanced security:** The kit provides robust security features, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and
secure key management

**For Users**
- **Simplified onboarding:** Users can create wallets and authenticate using familiar social logins, eliminating the
need for browser extensions or prior crypto knowledge.
- **Cross-app connectivity:** Users can navigate seamlessly across various applications within the Sei ecosystem using
a single wallet, enhancing interoperability and user experience.
- **User-friendly flows:** Features like transaction simulation help users understand the impact of each transaction
before confirmation, reducing risks and enhancing transparency.

#### Q: What login methods are currently supported?

Sei Global Wallets support an extensive list of social logins, such as email, Google, X and Telegram.

#### Q: Do Sei Global Wallets conform to EIP standards?
Yes, Sei Global Wallets conform to a specific EIP standard (EIP-6963) for injecting wallets, ensuring compatibility
with aggregated wallet services like RainbowKit and ConnectKit.

#### Q: How do the security considerations of a Sei Global Wallet differ from traditional wallets?

Unlike traditional wallets, which often rely on client-side storage of private keys, Sei Global Wallets prioritize
secure, encrypted interactions. Key differences include:

- **Secure encrypted communication:** All communication between an application and the Sei Global Wallet pop-up is
encrypted, ensuring that there is no exposure of sensitive data during transmission. Decryption only happens within
the wallet pop-up, and private keys are never exposed to the client or any external parties.
- **Protection against replay attacks:** Sei Global Wallets implement encrypted messaging, eliminating opportunities for
replay attacks. This means any intercepted data cannot be reused maliciously.
- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):** Encryption and decryption operations take place inside secure TEEs,
preventing unauthorized access to sensitive material. Even Dynamic, as the wallet provider, does not have access to
private keys, which remain secure within these isolated environments.
- **Only verified origins allowed:** To further enhance security, only verified origins are allowed to interact with
Sei Global Wallets. This ensures that all transactions and requests are made from trusted sources,


In addition to these, Dynamic-powered embedded wallets share the same principles of non-custodial security, ensuring
that only the user has access to their private keys. Dynamicâ€™s multi-layered security architecture includes encrypted
key storage, third-party audits, and ongoing bug bounty programs. Furthermore, wallets are always end-user controlled,
with the option for users to export their private keys to a different provider at any time.

#### Q: Are Sei Global Wallets self-custodial or custodial?
Sei Global Wallets and all Dynamic embedded wallets are self-custodial, giving full control and ownership to the
end-user. An end user can export their keys at any time and import them into a MetaMask or other external wallet.

#### Q: Do Sei Global Wallets require browser extensions?
No, they do not require browser extensions. They function as an embedded wallet that can be taken across the Sei
ecosystem.

#### Q: Can I link my existing external wallet to my Sei Global Wallet?
Not at the moment. In the future you will be able to link external wallets to a Sei global account.

#### Q: Can I put extra protections on my Sei Global Wallet?
While Global Wallets are self-custodial, we always recommend practicing good security hygiene. Here are some ways to
add additional protections:

- **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Adding an extra authentication layer for sensitive actions can further
secure your account.
- **Be cautious of phishing attempts:** Stay alert when entering security codes online, especially if prompted
unexpectedly. Always verify the source before sharing any sensitive information or interacting with unfamiliar requests.
- **Add additional backup options:** Link additional email or social login methods to your account. This ensures youâ€™ll
always have a way to recover access, even if your primary login method becomes unavailable.

#### Q: Have Sei Global Wallets been audited?
Yes, Sei Global Wallets, built by Dynamic, have been independently audited by Cure53, a leading security firm.
The audit included a comprehensive review of Dynamicâ€™s SDK, backend, and dashboard, with a specific focus on
cryptographic implementations. The auditors concluded that the codebase demonstrates a strong security posture,
modern architecture, and effective protection against common vulnerabilities such as XSS and SQL injection.

#### Q: A user or developer has reported a bug, such as a UI issue. How should they report it?

The person reporting should provide this info:
- Device
- Browser
- Description of the issue
- If possible, a Loom or screen recording

### Integration and Access

#### Q: How can developers using RainbowKit or WalletConnect integrate Sei Global Wallets into their application?

Developers using RainbowKit or WalletConnect can integrate Sei Global Wallets by installing and importing the
Sei Global Wallet. See full docs [here](#library-specific-examples).

#### Q: How can RainbowKit and WalletConnect developers make their Sei Global Wallet a recommended wallet?
You can follow the walkthrough in [Dynamic's docs to guide](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/global-wallets/web3-libraries)
your partners to add Sei Global Wallet as a recommended
wallet in their app.

#### Q: What should developers do if they have filtering issues with their wallet list?
If Sei Global Wallets do not appear in a developerâ€™s wallet list, they should check whether they have applied a custom
filter that might exclude it. Some wallet providers allow developers to modify which wallets are displayed, which could
cause integration issues.
