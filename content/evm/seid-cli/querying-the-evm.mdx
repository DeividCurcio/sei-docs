# Querying the EVM

You can query or send transactions to Sei easily via `seid` once you have the `seid` command installed.

## Network Configuration

If the machine you run these commands from are not running a node of the network, you'll need to append `--node http://url-to-sei-cosmos-rpc` to your command. Refer to the [RPC endpoints](/) at the bottom of the for a list of RPC endpoints.

## EVM Query Commands

### Get Associated Sei Address

Gets the associated Sei address of the queried EVM address, if it exists on-chain:

```bash copy
seid q evm sei-addr [some EVM address]
```

### Get Associated EVM Address

Gets the associated EVM address of the queried Sei address, if it exists on-chain:

```bash copy
seid q evm evm-addr [some Sei address]
```

### Query ERC20 Contract

Query the ERC20 contract at given address using the given method/arguments:

```bash copy
seid q evm erc20 [erc20 address] [method] [arguments...]
```

<Callout type="info" emoji={<IconInfoCircle className="h-5 w-5 mt-1" />}>
  Use standard ERC20 method names like `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, or `symbol` when querying contracts.
</Callout>

### Generate Payload

Generate the hexadecimal payload of the requested method call given an ABI:

```bash copy
seid q evm payload [abi-filepath] [method] [arguments...]
```

### Get Pointer Contract

Gets the pointer contract of the requested pointee. The `type` parameter can be one of "NATIVE", "CW20", "CW721", "ERC20", or "ERC721", and `pointee` is the target contract address. For "NATIVE" type, `pointee` would be the native denom name instead:

```bash copy
seid q evm pointer [type] [pointee]
```
