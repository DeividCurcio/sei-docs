# Transactions with seid

Sending transactions via CLI requires you to have keys added via `seid keys add`. You can then specify the key you want to use by appending `--from=[key name]` to your command.

If the machine you run these commands from are not a node of the network, you'd need to append `--evm-rpc http://url-to-sei-evm-rpc` to your command. Refer to the [RPC endpoints](/) at the bottom of the for a list of EVM RPC endpoints.

## EVM Transaction Commands

### Associate Address

Associates the Sei address and EVM address on-chain for the sending key:

```bash copy
seid tx evm associate-address
```

  This command links your Sei and EVM addresses, enabling cross-layer interactions.
</Callout>

### Send Native Tokens

Sends native tokens to the target EVM address:

```bash copy
seid tx evm send [to EVM address] [amount in wei]
```

### Deploy Contract

Deploys the EVM contract specified in `path_to_binary`:

```bash copy
seid tx evm deploy [path_to_binary]
```

### Call Contract

Sends a transaction that calls contract at the target address with the provided payload:

```bash copy
seid tx evm call-contract [addr] [payload hex]
```

### Send ERC20 Tokens

Sends ERC20 tokens of contract at `addr` to the target recipient:

```bash copy
seid tx evm erc20-send [addr] [recipient] [amount]
```

### Delegate to Validator

Delegates specified amount to the target validator address. The validator address must be in Sei validator address (`seivaloper1...`) format:

```bash copy
seid tx evm delegate [val-addr] [amount]
```
