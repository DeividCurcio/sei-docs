# Sei EVM Smart Contract Development with Foundry

Since Sei is an EVM compatible chain, existing EVM tooling like [foundry forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) or other could be re-used.

In this example we will be using [foundry tooling](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

Install the [foundry tooling](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) by following this [Installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html).

Create a new project following the [Creating New Project Guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/creating-a-new-project).

<Callout emoji="ðŸš€" title="Deploy to Testnet First">
  It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> that you deploy to <em>testnet (atlantic-2)</em> first and verify everything works as expected before committing to mainnet. Doing so helps you catch bugs early, avoid unnecessary gas costs, and keep your users safe.
</Callout>

Also make sure you have a wallet on Sei network.

Once project is created, tweak the contract code to the following, by adding a `getCounter` function:

```solidity copy
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }

    function getCount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return number;
    }
}

```

And the test code to the following:

```solidity copy
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {Counter} from "../src/Counter.sol";

contract CounterTest is Test {
    Counter public counter;

    function setUp() public {
        counter = new Counter();
        counter.setNumber(0);
    }

    function test_Increment() public {
        counter.increment();
        assertEq(counter.number(), 1);
    }

    function testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256 x) public {
        counter.setNumber(x);
        assertEq(counter.number(), x);
    }

    function test_GetCount() public {
        uint256 initialCount = counter.getCount();
        counter.increment();
        assertEq(counter.getCount(), initialCount + 1);
    }
}
```

Run the tests with the following command:

```bash copy
$ forge test
```

If tests pass, deploy the contract to the Sei chain with the following command:

```bash copy
$ forge create --rpc-url $SEI_NODE_URI --mnemonic $MNEMONIC src/Counter.sol:Counter --broadcast
```

Where `$SEI_NODE_URI` is the URI of the Sei node and `$MNEMONIC` is the mnemonic of the account that will deploy the contract. If you run local Sei node, the address will be `http://localhost:8545` , otherwise you could grab a `evm_rpc` url from the [registry](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/blob/main/chains.json). If deployment is successful, you will get the EVM contract address in the output.

```bash copy
[â ’] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Deployer: $0X_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS
Deployed to: $0X_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
Transaction hash: $0X_TX_HASH
```

Let's use the `cast` command to query the contract:

```bash copy
$ cast call $0X_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getCount()(uint256)" --rpc-url $SEI_NODE_URI
```

The command should return `0` as the initial value of the counter.

Now we can use the `cast` command to call the `increment` function:

```bash copy
$ cast send $0X_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "increment()" --mnemonic $MNEMONIC --rpc-url $SEI_NODE_URI
```

If command is successful, you will get the transaction hash and other info back.

Now let's call the `getCount` function again and this case it should return `1`.

```bash copy
$ cast call $0X_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getCount()(uint256)" --rpc-url $SEI_NODE_URI
```

<Callout type="info">Foundry generates the ABI for the contract in the `out` folder. You can use this ABI to interact with the contract from other tools like `ethers.js` or `web3.js`.</Callout>

## Calling contract using ethers.js

To call or query the contract from a frontend or a NodeJS script, you could use `ethers.js` like:

```tsx copy
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const privateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY;
const evmRpcEndpoint = YOUR_EVM_RPC_ENDPOINT;
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(evmRpcEndpoint);
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

if (!signer) {
  console.log('No signer found');
  return;
}
const abi = [
  {
    type: 'function',
    name: 'setNumber',
    inputs: [
      {
        name: 'newNumber',
        type: 'uint256',
        internalType: 'uint256'
      }
    ],
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: 'nonpayable'
  },
  {
    type: 'function',
    name: 'getCount',
    inputs: [],
    outputs: [
      {
        name: '',
        type: 'int256',
        internalType: 'int256'
      }
    ],
    stateMutability: 'view'
  },
  {
    type: 'function',
    name: 'increment',
    inputs: [],
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: 'nonpayable'
  }
];

// Define the address of the deployed contract
const contractAddress = `0X_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`;

// Create a new instance of the ethers.js Contract object
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer);

// Call the contract's functions
async function getCount() {
  const count = await contract.getCount();
  console.log(count.toString());
}

async function increment() {
  const txResponse = await contract.increment();
  const mintedTx = await txResponse.wait();
  console.log(mintedTx);
}

await increment();
await getCount();
```
