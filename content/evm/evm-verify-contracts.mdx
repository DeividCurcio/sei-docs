# Verify contract (EVM)

Verify your deployed contract using flattened source code, JSON input, Sourcify and more. Verifying your deployed contract ensures transparency and trust by making the source code publicly available and verifiable. Seitrace supports verification for both Solidity and Vyper contracts, with seven methods available through the Seitrace UI.

## Benefits of Verification

- Transparency: Publicly available source code.
- Trust: Community can verify the contract's functionality.
- Security: Greater confidence in the contract's integrity.

## API For EVM Contract verification

You can use these API URLs as a replacement for the `blockscout`verification
arctic-1: https://seitrace.com/arctic-1/api
pacific-1: https://seitrace.com/pacific-1/api
atlantic-2: https://seitrace.com/atlantic-2/api

Example:

```bash copy

forge verify-contract --watch --compiler-version "0.8.24" $CONTRACT_ADDRESS $CONTRACT_NAME
--verifier blockscout --verifier-url $VERIFIER_URL --etherscan-api-key random --force

```

## Seitrace UI

Verification is available for both Solidity and Vyper contracts. Currently, there are 6 methods for verification using the Seitrace UI. Access function at: https://seitrace.com/contract-verification

Go to the Verify contract page (Resources -> Verify contract (EVM))

Enter in the contract address you received during deployment. The dropdown will show you several available verification options. Select the one you would like to use and continue.

- Solidity (Flattened source code)
- Solidity (Standard JSON input)
- Solidity (Multi-part files)
- Vyper (Contract)
- Vyper (Multi-part files)
- Vyper (Standard JSON input)

### Solidity (Flattened source code)

1. **Contract Address:** The 0x address supplied on contract creation (added above)
2. **Is Yul contract:** Select if the contract is coded in Yul for efficiency.
3. **Include Nightly Builds:** Select if you want to show nightly builds.
4. **Compiler:** derived from the first line in the contract pragma solidity X.X.X. Use the corresponding compiler version rather than the nightly build.
5. **EVM Version:** Select the correct EVM version if known, otherwise use default.
6. **Optimization Enabled:** If you enabled optimization during compilation, select and enter the run value. 200 is the Solidity Compiler default value. Only change if you changed this value while compiling.
7. **Enter the Solidity Contract Code:** You may need to flatten your solidity code if it utilizes a library or inherits dependencies from another contract. We recommend hardhat or the POA solidity flattener.
8. **Add Contract Libraries:** Enter the name and 0x address for any required libraries called in the .sol file. You can add multiple contracts with the "+" button.

9. Click the `Verify and Publish` button.
10. If all goes well, you will see a checkmark ✅ next to Code in the code tab, and an additional tab called `Read Contract`. The contract name will now appear in Seitrace with any transactions related to your contract.

### Solidity (Standard JSON input)

[More information on JSON input is available here.](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#input-description)

1. **Include nightly builds:** You can choose Yes or No depending on your compiler.
2. **Compiler:** Choose the compiler version used to compile your smart contract. If you selected yes for nightly builds, use the compiler version rather than the build.
3. **Standard Input JSON:** Upload your Standard Input JSON file. File should follow the [Solidity format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#input-description) and all the sources must be in Literal Content format, not a URL.

Click the **Verify & Publish** button and wait for the response.

### Vyper Contract

1.  **Contract Name:** Name assigned to the contract.
2.  **Compiler:** Select the compiler version used in the source code.
3.  **EVM Version:** Select the correct EVM version if known, otherwise use default.
4.  **Contract Code:** Copy and paste the contract code
5.  Click the `Verify and Publish` button.

If all goes well, you will see a checkmark ✅ next to Code in the code tab, and an additional tab called `Read Contract`.

The contract name will now appear in BlockScout with any transactions related to your contract.

### Vyper Multi-part files and standard json input

See the information above.

### Troubleshooting

If you receive the `There was an error compiling your contract` message this means the bytecode doesn't match the supplied sourcecode.

Unfortunately, there are many reasons this may be the case. Here are a few things to try:

1.  Double check the compiler version is correct.
    Check all version digits - for example `0.5.1` is different from `0.5.10`
2.  Check that an extra space has not been added to the end of the contract. When pasting in, an extra space may be added. Delete this and attempt to recompile.
3.  Copy, paste, and verify your source code in Remix. You may find some exceptions here.
