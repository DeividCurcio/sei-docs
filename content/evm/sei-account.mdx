Sei Account is a cross-application embedded crypto wallet powered by
[Dynamic Global Wallets](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/global-wallets/overview) that is accessed via conventional
login methods (i.e., email, X, Telegram). With Sei Account, users gain access to the same embedded wallet on any
integrated app within the Sei ecosystem-- enabling seamless onboarding without fragmenting liquidity
(or adding an extra deposit step) for your users.
Integrating is straightforward for developers using EIP-6963-compatible wallets or libraries like RainbowKit,
WalletConnectKit, or Dynamic. Our lightweight SDK allows to easily add Sei Account to your app with just a
few lines of code.

### Benefits of the Sei Account

- Simplifies onboarding for users
- Provides a seamless way for users to explore onchain apps without a browser extension or native app
- Allows developers to utilize a secure popup that is compatible with RainbowKit, WalletConnect, and Dynamic
- Offers users simple login flows without compromising access to liquidity
- Works across all dApps that use EIP-6963-compatible wallets or libraries

### Features
- Does not require a browser extension
- Login with email
- Social login (Google, X, Telegram)
- All existing wallets will work as well (e.g. Metamask, Trust, WalletConnect, Coinbase)

## EIP-6963
EIP-6963 is a standardized communication protocol for embedded wallets, enabling seamless cross-application
interoperability in the web3 ecosystem. It defines a common API for:

- Wallet Discovery & Pairing: Allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to locate and securely connect with embedded wallets.
- Authentication & Session Management: Facilitating unified login experiences and secure authentication across multiple apps.
- Transaction Signing: Providing a consistent method for users to sign transactions through their embedded wallets.

## Library Specific Examples

Here are some examples of how to use Sei Account with some popular libraries: Dynamic, WalletConnect and RainbowKit.

### Dynamic

        ```tsx copy filename="layout.tsx"
        "use client";

        import "./globals.css";

        import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
        import Providers from "@/lib/providers";

        const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

        import '@sei-js/sei-account/eip6963';

        export default function RootLayout({
        children,
    }: {
         children: React.ReactNode;
    }) {
        return (
            <html lang="en">
              <body className={inter.className}>
                <Providers>{children}</Providers>
              </body>
            </html>
          );
        }
     ```

          // Your dApps chains
          chains: [seiTestnet],
          transports: {
            // RPC URL for each chain
            [seiTestnet.id]: http(),
          },

      })
    );

        const queryClient = new QueryClient();

        export const Web3Provider: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
        return (
          <WagmiProvider config={config}>
            <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
              <ConnectKitProvider>{children}</ConnectKitProvider>
            </QueryClientProvider>
          </WagmiProvider>
          );
        };

        createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
          <StrictMode>
              <Web3Provider>
                  <ConnectKitButton />

        import { QueryClientProvider, QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

        import "@sei-js/sei-account/eip6963";

        const queryClient = new QueryClient();

        const config = getDefaultConfig({
          appName: "My RainbowKit App",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          chains: [seiTestnet],
          ssr: true, // If your dApp uses server side rendering (SSR)
    });

        createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
          <StrictMode>
              <WagmiProvider config={config}>
