Sei Account is powered by [Dynamic Global Wallets](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/global-wallets/overview) that enables smooth
user onboarding by providing embedded wallet that does not require installation of any additional wallet add-ons.

Integration into existing dApp requires few lines of code and will work seamlessly across all dApps, provided dApp uses
EIP-6963-compatible wallets or libraries like RainbowKit, WalletConnect, Dynamic itself and others.

## EIP-6963
EIP-6963 is a standardized communication protocol for embedded wallets, enabling seamless cross-application
interoperability in the web3 ecosystem. It defines a common API for:

- Wallet Discovery & Pairing: Allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to locate and securely connect with embedded wallets.
- Authentication & Session Management: Facilitating unified login experiences and secure authentication across multiple apps.
- Transaction Signing: Providing a consistent method for users to sign transactions through their embedded wallets.

## Installation

1.**Install Sei Account Package**

```bash copy
yarn add @sei-js/sei-account
```
or
```bash copy
npm install @sei-js/sei-account
```

2.**Importing the Sei Account**
To use this wallet with any wallet provider that supports the EIP-6963 standard, you need to import the wallet
package in your project.

```javascript copy
 import "@sei-js/sei-account/eip6963";
 ```

For example, if you are using the Dynamic library, you can import the Sei Account package as follows:

```javascript
import { DynamicContextProvider } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";
import { DynamicWagmiConnector } from "@dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector";
import { createConfig, WagmiProvider } from "wagmi";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { http } from "viem";
import { sei, seiTestnet } from "viem/chains";
import Main from "./Main";
import '@sei-js/sei-account/eip6963';


const config = createConfig({
  chains: [sei, seiTestnet],
  multiInjectedProviderDiscovery: false,
  transports: {
    [sei.id]: http(),
    [seiTestnet.id]: http(),
  },
});

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const App = () => (
  <DynamicContextProvider
    theme="auto"
    settings={{
      environmentId: "<Yor Dynamic Environment ID>",
      walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors],
    }}
  >
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <DynamicWagmiConnector>
          <Main />
        </DynamicWagmiConnector>
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  </DynamicContextProvider>
);

export default App;
```

3.**Use Sei Account**
Your Sei Account is now ready to use within the project.
