# Installing seid CLI

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19+: Installation instructions are available [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Installation

To install seid, locate the version you wish to use [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/releases), and then execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain
cd sei-chain
git checkout v6.0.3
make install
```

You can verify that seid was installed correctly by running:

```bash
seid version
```

## Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter an error like `command not found: seid`, you may need to set your GOPATH environment variable.

- Use `go env GOPATH` to find your GOPATH
- Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export GOPATH=[your GOPATH from step 1]
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

For more information see [here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable).

## Adding a Wallet

You can create a new wallet using the seid keys command:

```bash
seid keys add $NAME
```

Please replace `$NAME` with the name you would like to use for this key. This will generate a seed phrase and store the account in the CLI for use. Write this mnemonic down and store it in a safe place.

Alternatively, if you would like to import an existing seed phrase, you can add the `--recover` flag:

```bash
seid keys add $NAME --recover
```

You will then be prompted to input your seed phrase.

## EVM Wallet Import

If you are importing from an EVM wallet like MetaMask, you may need to specify the coin type. Ethereum (EVM) based wallets use coin type `60`, while the default on Sei is `118`.

For example:

```bash
seid keys add $NAME --coin-type=60
```

This will generate a different address than the default coin type of `118`.

## Managing Wallets

To see your local wallets, you can run:

```bash
seid keys list
```

to see a list of all wallets added, or

```bash
seid keys show $NAME
```

to see details about a specific wallet.
