# Distribution Precompile

**Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001007`

This precompile enables EVM clients to withdraw staking rewards, manage withdrawal addresses, and query reward information.

## Functions

### Transactions

- `setWithdrawAddress`: Sets the EVM Address to withdraw funds to for the
  account.

  ```solidity copy
    /// Sets the withdrawal address for the caller's staking rewards.
    /// The caller must have a valid associated Sei address.
    /// @param withdrawAddr The EVM address where rewards should be sent.
    /// @return success True if the withdrawal address was set successfully.
    function setWithdrawAddress(
        address withdrawAddr
    ) external returns (bool success);
  ```

- `withdrawDelegationRewards`: Withdraws delegation rewards from a specific validator.

  ```solidity copy
    /// Withdraws delegation rewards from a specific validator.
    /// The caller must be a delegator to the specified validator.
    /// @param validator The validator's Sei address (e.g., "seivaloper1...").
    /// @return success True if rewards were withdrawn successfully.
    function withdrawDelegationRewards(
        string memory validator
    ) external returns (bool success);
  ```

- `withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards`: Withdraws delegation rewards from multiple validators in a single transaction.

```solidity copy
  /// Withdraws delegation rewards from multiple validators in a single transaction.
  /// More gas efficient than calling withdrawDelegationRewards multiple times.
  /// @param validators Array of validator Sei addresses.
  /// @return success True if all rewards were withdrawn successfully.
  function withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards(
        string[] memory validators
  ) external returns (bool success);
```

- `withdrawValidatorCommission`: Withdraws validator commission (only callable by the validator operator).

```solidity copy
  /// Withdraws validator commission (only callable by the validator operator).
  /// Only the validator operator can withdraw their commission.
  /// @param validator The validator's Sei address (must match caller's validator).
  /// @return success True if commission was withdrawn successfully.
  function withdrawValidatorCommission(
        string memory validator
  ) external returns (bool success);
```

### Queries

- `rewards`: Gets all pending rewards for a delegator.

```solidity copy
  /// Represents a coin/token with amount, decimals, and denomination
  struct Coin {
      /// The amount of tokens (as a big integer)
      uint256 amount;
      /// Number of decimal places for display purposes
      uint256 decimals;
      /// Token denomination (e.g., "usei", "uatom")
      string denom;
  }

  /// Represents rewards from a specific validator
  struct Reward {
      /// Array of different coin types earned as rewards
      Coin[] coins;
      /// The validator's Sei address that generated these rewards
      string validator_address;
  }

  /// Aggregated rewards information for a delegator
  struct Rewards {
      /// Array of rewards from each validator
      Reward[] rewards;
      /// Total rewards summed across all validators
      Coin[] total;
  }

  /// Gets all pending rewards for a delegator.
  /// Returns rewards from all validators the address has delegated to.
  /// @param delegatorAddress The EVM address of the delegator.
  /// @return rewards Structured data containing all pending rewards.
  /// Rewards are usually returned as decimals. To calculate the actual amount, divide the amount by decimals.
  function rewards(
      address delegatorAddress
  ) external view returns (Rewards rewards);
