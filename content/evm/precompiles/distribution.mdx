# Distribution Precompile

**Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001007`

The distribution precompile provides EVM access to Cosmos SDK's distribution module. Smart contracts can manage staking rewards, validator commissions, and withdrawal addresses. This precompile is essential for DeFi applications that need to handle staking rewards programmatically.

## Key Features

- **Reward Management**: Withdraw delegation rewards from validators
- **Commission Handling**: Validators can withdraw earned commissions  
- **Batch Operations**: Withdraw from multiple validators efficiently
- **Flexible Withdrawals**: Set custom withdrawal addresses
- **Comprehensive Queries**: Access detailed reward information

## Interface Overview

```solidity
interface IDistr {
    // Transaction Methods
    function setWithdrawAddress(address withdrawAddr) external returns (bool);
    function withdrawDelegationRewards(string memory validator) external returns (bool);
    function withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards(string[] memory validators) external returns (bool);
    function withdrawValidatorCommission(string memory validator) external returns (bool);
    
    // Query Methods  
    function rewards(address delegatorAddress) external view returns (Rewards);
}
```

## Transaction Methods

### setWithdrawAddress

Sets the withdrawal address for staking rewards. By default, rewards are sent to the delegator's address, but this can be customized.

```solidity
function setWithdrawAddress(address withdrawAddr) external returns (bool success);
```

**Parameters:**
- `withdrawAddr`: EVM address where future rewards should be sent

**Gas Cost**: ~30,000 gas

**Example:**
```solidity
// Set rewards to go to a treasury contract
bool success = DISTR_CONTRACT.setWithdrawAddress(0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96590c6C8C);
require(success, "Failed to set withdraw address");
```

### withdrawDelegationRewards

Withdraws accumulated rewards from a specific validator.

```solidity
function withdrawDelegationRewards(string memory validator) external returns (bool success);
```

**Parameters:**
- `validator`: Sei validator address (e.g., "seivaloper1...")

**Gas Cost**: ~50,000-80,000 gas (varies by reward amount)

**Example:**
```solidity
string memory validator = "seivaloper1xyz...";
bool success = DISTR_CONTRACT.withdrawDelegationRewards(validator);
require(success, "Failed to withdraw rewards");
```

### withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards

Efficiently withdraws rewards from multiple validators in a single transaction.

```solidity
function withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards(string[] memory validators) external returns (bool success);
```

**Parameters:**
- `validators`: Array of Sei validator addresses

**Gas Cost**: ~40,000 + (30,000 Ã— number of validators)

**Example:**
```solidity
string[] memory validators = new string[](3);
validators[0] = "seivaloper1abc...";
validators[1] = "seivaloper1def..."; 
validators[2] = "seivaloper1ghi...";

bool success = DISTR_CONTRACT.withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards(validators);
require(success, "Failed to withdraw multiple rewards");
```

<Callout type="info">
**Batch Efficiency**: Using `withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards` is significantly more gas-efficient than multiple individual calls, especially when withdrawing from 3+ validators.
</Callout>

### withdrawValidatorCommission

Allows validators to withdraw their earned commission. Only callable by the validator operator.

```solidity
function withdrawValidatorCommission(string memory validator) external returns (bool success);
```

**Parameters:**
- `validator`: Sei validator address (must match caller's validator)

**Gas Cost**: ~60,000-90,000 gas

**Example:**
```solidity
// Only works if caller is the validator operator
string memory myValidator = "seivaloper1myvalidator...";
bool success = DISTR_CONTRACT.withdrawValidatorCommission(myValidator);
require(success, "Failed to withdraw commission");
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Validator Only**: This method can only be called by the validator's operator address. Attempting to withdraw commission for a validator you don't operate will fail.
</Callout>

## Query Methods

### rewards

Retrieves comprehensive reward information for a delegator across all validators.

```solidity
function rewards(address delegatorAddress) external view returns (Rewards rewards);
```

**Data Structures:**
```solidity
struct Coin {
    uint256 amount;    // Token amount (raw units)
    uint256 decimals;  // Decimal places for display
    string denom;      // Token denomination
}

struct Reward {
    Coin[] coins;              // Reward coins from this validator
    string validator_address;  // Validator's Sei address
}

struct Rewards {
    Reward[] rewards;  // Per-validator breakdown
    Coin[] total;      // Total rewards across all validators
}
```

**Example:**
```solidity
Rewards memory userRewards = DISTR_CONTRACT.rewards(msg.sender);

// Check total rewards
for (uint i = 0; i < userRewards.total.length; i++) {
    Coin memory coin = userRewards.total[i];
    uint256 displayAmount = coin.amount / (10 ** coin.decimals);
    // Process reward amount for coin.denom
}

// Check per-validator rewards
for (uint i = 0; i < userRewards.rewards.length; i++) {
    Reward memory reward = userRewards.rewards[i];
    // Process rewards from reward.validator_address
}
```

## Practical Examples

### DeFi Yield Aggregator

```solidity
contract YieldAggregator {
    IDistr constant DISTR = IDistr(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001007);
    
    mapping(address => string[]) public userValidators;
    
    function harvestRewards() external {
        string[] memory validators = userValidators[msg.sender];
        require(validators.length > 0, "No validators to harvest from");
        
        // Efficiently withdraw from all validators
        bool success = DISTR.withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards(validators);
        require(success, "Harvest failed");
        
        // Additional logic to compound or distribute rewards
    }
    
    function checkPendingRewards(address user) external view returns (uint256 totalSei) {
        Rewards memory rewards = DISTR.rewards(user);
        
        for (uint i = 0; i < rewards.total.length; i++) {
            if (keccak256(bytes(rewards.total[i].denom)) == keccak256(bytes("usei"))) {
                totalSei = rewards.total[i].amount;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Validator Commission Manager

```solidity
contract ValidatorManager {
    IDistr constant DISTR = IDistr(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001007);
    
    string public validatorAddress;
    address public treasury;
    
    constructor(string memory _validator, address _treasury) {
        validatorAddress = _validator;
        treasury = _treasury;
        
        // Set commission withdrawals to go to treasury
        DISTR.setWithdrawAddress(treasury);
    }
    
    function withdrawCommission() external {
        bool success = DISTR.withdrawValidatorCommission(validatorAddress);
        require(success, "Commission withdrawal failed");
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

Common error scenarios and how to handle them:

```solidity
contract SafeDistribution {
    IDistr constant DISTR = IDistr(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001007);
    
    function safeWithdrawRewards(string memory validator) external returns (bool) {
        // Check if there are rewards to withdraw first
        Rewards memory rewards = DISTR.rewards(msg.sender);
        
        bool hasRewards = false;
        for (uint i = 0; i < rewards.rewards.length; i++) {
            if (keccak256(bytes(rewards.rewards[i].validator_address)) == 
                keccak256(bytes(validator))) {
                hasRewards = rewards.rewards[i].coins.length > 0;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (!hasRewards) {
            return false; // No rewards to withdraw
        }
        
        try DISTR.withdrawDelegationRewards(validator) returns (bool success) {
            return success;
        } catch {
            return false; // Handle withdrawal failure gracefully
        }
    }
}
```

## Gas Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Operations**: Use `withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards` for multiple validators
2. **Check Before Withdraw**: Query rewards first to avoid unnecessary transactions
3. **Set Withdraw Address Once**: Avoid repeated `setWithdrawAddress` calls
4. **Commission Timing**: Withdraw validator commission when amounts are substantial

## Integration Patterns

### Auto-Compounding Strategy
```solidity
// Automatically reinvest rewards back into staking
function autoCompound() external {
    // 1. Withdraw rewards
    DISTR.withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards(getMyValidators());
    
    // 2. Use staking precompile to re-delegate
    // (Implementation depends on staking precompile integration)
}
```

### Treasury Management
```solidity
// Route all rewards to a DAO treasury
function setupTreasuryWithdrawals(address treasury) external onlyOwner {
    DISTR.setWithdrawAddress(treasury);
}
```
