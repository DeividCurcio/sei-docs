# Why Sei EVM?

The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is used to process transactions in
blockchains such as Ethereum. Most crypto native developers are extremely
familiar with the EVM.

Unfortunately, the EVM is quite inefficient - on Ethereum L1, it's not able to
process more than ~20 TPS.

This results in

- high transaction fees for users, often going into hundreds of dollars for
  simple transactions
- a restricted design space for developers, who are unable to build high
  performance applications

Sei represents a 100x improvement on the EVM. This will unlock an entirely new
design space for application developers, and make the EVM much cheaper to access
for normal people.
